## T1D-scRNAseq
Code for "TGF-β-mediated crosstalk between TIGIT+ Tregs and CD226+ CD8+ T cells in the progression and remission of type 1 diabetes".


## Description:
Shortly after Type 1 diabetes (T1D) diagnosis and initiation of insulin therapy, a considerable number of patients enter a phase of partial remission (PR), often referred to as the "honeymoon period". This unique phase provides a natural model for investigating the restoration of immune tolerance toward β cells within the context of T1D. To this end, we utilized single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to dissect the immune landscapes of peripheral immune cells in new-onset T1D patients, those in PR, and healthy donors HDs.


## Requirements:
R>=4.6.1

Python>=3.6


## How to run this project:
To make the R code run, we provided a test dataset (./data/targetcell.rds) generated by sampling from our total scRNA-seq data. The analysis of scRNA-seq data in R follows the Seurat standard process. The standard processing flow of Seurat in this study can be found in the R script: "Seurat process.R". The analysis process of using scDblFinder to find doublets can be found in the R script: "Doublet finder process.R". The transcription factor activity analysis can be found in the R script: "SCENIC process.R".The relevant process of pseudotime analysis can be found in the R script: "Monocle process.R". Details of cell-cell communication analysis can be found in the R script: "CellChat process.R". Before the Python code can run, you need to prepare a count table file or AnnData generated from Scanpy.
