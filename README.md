## T1D-scRNAseq
Code for "TGF-β-mediated crosstalk between TIGIT+ Tregs and CD226+ CD8+ T cells in the progression and remission of type 1 diabetes".


## Description:
Shortly after Type 1 diabetes (T1D) diagnosis and initiation of insulin therapy, a considerable number of patients enter a phase of partial remission (PR), often referred to as the "honeymoon period". This unique phase provides a natural model for investigating the restoration of immune tolerance toward β cells within the context of T1D. To this end, we utilized single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to dissect the immune landscapes of peripheral immune cells in new-onset T1D patients, those in PR, and healthy donors HDs.

## Requirements:
R>=4.6.1
Python>=3.6

## How to run this project:
To make the R code run, we provided a test dataset (./data/targetcell.rds) generated by sampling from our total scRNA-seq data. The analysis of scRNA-seq data in R follows the Seurat standard process. 

Before the Python code can run, you need to prepare a count table file or AnnData generated from Scanpy (https://github.com/scverse/scanpy). You can refer to the CellTypist method for details (https://github.com/Teichlab/celltypist).

## Installation guide & Demo
